## 1. Introduction

Weak passwords are a leading cause of security breaches, with hackers exploiting simple or predictable passwords to gain unauthorized access. This Password Strength Checker Application helps users create stronger passwords by providing real-time feedback on password quality.

The Java-based application uses regular expressions (regex) for pattern matching and Apache Commons Lang library to evaluate password strength. It analyzes password length, character diversity, and common patterns to classify passwords as weak, medium, or strong. The interactive command-line interface detects vulnerabilities like short length, lack of character diversity, and common patterns. The project is containerized using Docker for cross-platform deployment.

---

## 2. Objectives of the Project

Develop a password analysis system with regex pattern recognition, actionable feedback, Apache Commons Lang integration, intuitive CLI, comprehensive JUnit testing, Docker containerization, and Maven build management.

---

## 3. Problem Statement / Need of the Project

Over 80% of data breaches involve weak or stolen passwords. Users create passwords with insufficient length, predictable patterns (123, qwerty), lack of character diversity, and repeated characters without understanding why they're weak.

This project addresses the need for an educational tool that provides immediate feedback, detects weak patterns, offers clear recommendations, and works across all platforms. The target audience includes individual users, students learning cybersecurity, organizations training employees, and developers understanding input validation.

---

## 4. Scope of the Project

Real-time password analysis with three strength levels using multi-criteria evaluation (length, character types, patterns). Implements score-based system (0-8 points) with Java 11, Maven, Apache Commons Lang, JUnit testing, and Docker containerization. Future enhancements include web interface, password generator, and mobile applications.

---

## 5. Methodology / Tools Used

Agile development with Java 11, Maven 3.9, Apache Commons Lang 3.14.0, JUnit 4.13.2, Docker, and Git/GitHub. Implements regex patterns for character detection, object-oriented design, and multi-stage Docker builds.

---

## 6. Expected Outcomes

Functional password strength checker with accurate classification, detailed feedback, cross-platform Docker deployment, clean code architecture, and >80% test coverage. Users gain security awareness through real-time password analysis with complete documentation.

---

## 7. Project Timeline

Week 1: Planning and design; Week 2-3: Core development; Week 3: Testing; Week 4: Docker containerization; Week 4-5: Documentation; Week 5: Final testing. Total: 5-6 weeks.
